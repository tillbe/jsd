# R package for Jensen-Shannon Divergence

Simple R package to compute the [Jensen-Shannon divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence) between two probability functions. 
Can also compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence on which JSD is based.

You can install the package with:

```{r}
